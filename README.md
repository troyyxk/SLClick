This is a practice project for SilverLight.

I make this because I am currently having a new task requires me to add feature to an already existing SilverLight application.

I figured out that I am not going to make progress with this task unless I have some basic understanding of SilverLight and here I am trying a web application of it.

Do not really understand why people would visit this project but since you are reading the text, hope you enjoy reading the code and wish you a great day!
